#
#   Function to initialize all space indices.

"""
    init(::Type{T}; kwargs...) where T<:SpaceIndexSet -> Nothing

Initialize the space index set `T`.

This function will download the remote files associated with the space index set `T` if they
do not exist or if their expiry period has been elapsed. Aftward, it will parse the files
and populate the object to be accessed by the function [`space_index`](@ref).

# Keywords

- `force_download::Bool`: If `true`, the remote files will be downloaded regardless of their
    timestamps. (**Default** = `false`)

`blocklist`.
