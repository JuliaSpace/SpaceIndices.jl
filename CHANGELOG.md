SpaceIndices.jl Changelog
=========================

Version 1.2.0
-------------

- ![Feature][badge-feature] We can pass the keyword `filepaths` to the function
  `SpaceIndices.init` when initializing individual sets to specify local files with the
  indices. Hence, the algorithm will use those paths instead of downloading the indices from
  the locations in `urls` function. (Issue [#6][gh-issue-6])

Verison 1.1.2
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] We updated the URLs of the space indices related to the JB2008
  atmospheric model. (Issue [#5][gh-issue-5])

Version 1.1.1
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] We can now process the file `SW-All.csv` if there are invalid
  lines. In those cases, the lines will be rejected. (Issue [#4][gh-issue-4])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We now use the Julian Day instead of `DateTime` as the
  internal date representation. Notice that the public API has not changed. This
  modification made SpaceIndices.jl compatible with automatic differentiation packages.
  (PR [#3][gh-pr-3])
- ![Info][badge-info] The Kp and Ap vectors returned by `space_index` are now `Vector`s
  instead of `Tuple`s.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We now use the Celestrak file `SW-All.csv` to obtain
  some space indices such as the F10.7, Ap, and Kp. We also removed the old files
  `fluxtable.txt` and `Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107_since_1932.txt`. Notice that this modification **is
  not considered** to be breaking because all indices can be fetched using the same
  functions (API). (PR [#2][gh-pr-2]))
- ![Feature][badge-feature] We added some other indices available in `SW-All.csv`.
  (PR [#2][gh-pr-2]))

Version 1.0.0
-------------

- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] We renamed all the API and initialization functions to improve
  name consistency. Now, only the function `space_index` is exported. All others must be
  accessed using `SpaceIndices.` prefix.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] We added the following space index sets: `JB2008` and `KpAp`.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We now re-export the modules `OptionalData` and `Dates`.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We remove the dependency on **Interpolations.jl**
  because we only require simple interpolation algorithms (1D-constant and linear). Hence,
  we could implement fast algorithms inside the package, reducing the loading time.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

- Initial version.
  - This version was based on the code in **SatelliteToolbox.jl**. However, many API changes
    were implemented.
